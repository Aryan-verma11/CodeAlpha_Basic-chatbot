# CodeAlpha_Basic-chatbot
This project is a basic chatbot built in Python using simple if-else rules to simulate conversations. The chatbot can greet users, answer basic questions (like its name, current time, and date), and respond politely to user queries. It runs in the console and continues chatting until the user types "bye".
